# AssemblySnake
Very basic snake game in Assembly
- A small game to refresh my knowledge of Assembly code.
- Very basic difficulty system that just increases the movement speed.
- Has all the mechanics of a standard snake game except collision with yourself.
- Basic title screen, main menu, score tracking, and game over screen.
- Not very impressive, but it was a fun afternoon project.
